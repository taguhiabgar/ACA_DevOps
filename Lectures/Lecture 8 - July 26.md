`jobs` - to see what are the current jobs

To make a job to run in background or foreground there are these commands:

- `bg`

`&` at the end of a command means that the command should be running in the background.

To make a command not to output data we can write `nohup` command in the beginning of our command. Also `nohup` makes the command not dependent on the shell it was initiated from, so that when the shell is closed, the job will continue to run. The output goes to `nohup.out` file.
